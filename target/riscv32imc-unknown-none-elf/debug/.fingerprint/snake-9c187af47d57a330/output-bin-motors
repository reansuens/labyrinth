If using Cargo, add it to `[dependencies]`\n  in Cargo.toml.\n- The crate is present, but under a different name. If using Cargo, look for\n  `package = ` under `[dependencies]` in Cargo.toml.\n\n## Common causes for missing `std` or `core`\n\n- You are cross-compiling for a target which doesn't have `std` prepackaged.\n  Consider one of the following:\n  + Adding a pre-compiled version of std with `rustup target add`\n  + Building std from source with `cargo build -Z build-std`\n  + Using `#![no_std]` at the crate root, so you won't need `std` in the first\n    place.\n- You are developing the compiler itself and haven't built libstd from source.\n  You can usually build it with `x.py build library/std`.
